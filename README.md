# Hi
I'm Luukas Paukkonen, Co-founder and Game Designer at [Silverzone Oy](https://silverzonegames.com/about). I'm more than interested in game design and development alongside being a huge nerd. I am a huge automization and optimization fan, I'll do everything in my power to automate and optimize my work. I also work closely with Silverzone's information security and management teams.

I'm also a streamer and content creator on my free time.

## What is my education
I'm currently a student in high school and I am aiming to get a degree in Business and AI/ML in a university after I graduate. As for programming, game design and information technology skills I am self taught, as are my business partners.

I would also consider myself a polyglot, knowing 5 languages on at least a conversational level. Finnish and English are my preferred languages though.

## My development career
I am primarily a web/API developer at Silverzone. My job is to make sure that our website and services are up-to-date and accurate. I also manage IT assets and sometimes develop extensions for tools. <br/>

## My expertise
I would say I'm semi-proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript and Python. In addition I have a general understanding of C, C++ and C#. I like solving problems programatically.
<br/>
I would also say I'm good enough in understanding cloud computing, especially on Azure, Terraform and Docker and server administration.

## My hobbies and free time
I like to play video games and watch other people play them too (albeit my YouTube feed is full of development videos and tech news). I am also a streamer on Twitch, though I don't currently stream actively.
As for my other hobbies, I like cycling and swimming in the summer and ice skating in the winter. I also draw digitally sometimes.
