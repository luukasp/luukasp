# Hi
I'm Luukas Paukkonen, Co-founder and Game Designer at [Silverzone Oy](https://silverzonegames.com/about). I'm more than interested in game design and development alongside being a huge nerd. I am a huge automization and optimization fan, I'll do everything in my power to automate and optimize my work. I also work closely with Silverzone's information security and management teams.

## What is my education
I'm currently a student in high school and am aiming to get to a commerce line in an university after I graduate. As for programming, game design and information technology skills I am self taught, as are my partners in business. I am also multi-lingual as are most of my aquintances.
