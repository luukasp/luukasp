# Hi
I'm Luukas Paukkonen, Co-founder, President and Game Designer at [Silverzone Oy](https://silverzonegames.com/about). I'm more than interested in game design and development alongside being a huge nerd. I am a huge automization and optimization fan, I'll do everything in my power to automate and optimize my work. I also work closely with Silverzone's information security and management teams.

## What is my education
I'm currently a student in high school and am aiming to get to a commerce line in a university after I graduate. As for programming, game design and information technology skills I am self taught, as are my partners in business. I am also multi-lingual as are most of my aquintances.

## My development career
I am primarily a web/API developer at Silverzone. My job is to make sure that our website and services are up-to-date and accurate. I also manage IT assets and sometimes develop extensions for tools. <br/>
I am also involved in a bunch of C/C++ development with my friends as a hobby.

## My expertise
I would say I'm semi-proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript and Python. In addition I have a general understanding of C, C++, C# and Java. I like solving problems programatically. <br/>
I am also semi-knowledgeable about Microsoft Azure Cloud and attached Microsoft services, such as Azure AD and the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. I have also tinkered with Windows and Windows Server, including Active Directory components, such as AD DS and AD FS. I still wouldn't say I am competent in AD administration.

## My hobbies and free time
I like to play video games and watch other people play them too (albeit my YouTube feed is full of development videos and tech news). I am also a streamer on Twitch, though I don't currently stream activelly.
As for my other hobbies, I like cycling and swimming in the summer and ice skating in the winter.
